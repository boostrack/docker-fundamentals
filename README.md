# Docker Fundamentals
![Docker Fundamentals](/artifacts/container_port.png?raw=true)

This repository contains the content of an introductory training course for the [Docker platform](https://www.docker.com): Docker Fundamentals. The course assumes no knowledge of Docker itself, but assumes some knowledge of the Linux command line and
 concepts related to software application development and delivery.

The course comprises of a number of units, each containing a set of slides, student notes and a lab exercise. The student notes provide the detail associated with each slide, and each lab exercise aims to reinforce the content of the unit. The student notes should be read in continuous, dual page mode, as the notes appear next to an image of the presentation slide.

The slides are based on the [reveal.js HTML presentation framework](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), and run inside a Docker container. Instructions for running the presentations are included in each unit folder.
